### 🚀 SmartBizGrow — AI-Powered Local Business Growth Platform
(Also known as “BizBoost AI” or “AI-Powered Local Business Growth Platform”)

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Small and local businesses — such as shops, salons, cafés, or tuition centers — often struggle to grow because they:

Don’t know how to reach the right customers online

As a result, they rely only on word-of-mouth and lose ground to big chains or digital-first competitors.
